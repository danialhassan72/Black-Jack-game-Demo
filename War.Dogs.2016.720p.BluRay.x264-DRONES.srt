1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000


2
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,950
Please! Please!

3
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,079
I'm sorry, I don't speak Albanian!

4
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,757
Stop! I don't understand!

5
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,200
Do you understand now?

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,752
That's a Jericho 941
pointed at my head.

7
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,237
You can get one
on the black market for $300.

8
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,439
Yeah.

9
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,028
It is a very reliable weapon.

10
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,990
My name is David Packouz.

11
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,395
And I'm an international arms dealer.

12
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,715
What do you know about war?

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,349
They'll tell you it's about
patriotism, democracy

14
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,067
or some shit about the other guy
hating our freedom.

15
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,275
But you want to know
what it's really about?

16
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,518
What do you see?

17
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,719
A kid from Arkansas

18
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,433
doing his patriotic duty
to defend his country?

19
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,235
I see a helmet, fire-retardant gloves,

20
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,396
body armor, and an M16.

21
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,639
I see $17,500.

22
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,959
That's what it costs to outfit
one American soldier.

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,188
Over two million soldiers

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,276
fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.

25
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,388
It cost the American taxpayer
$4. 5 billion each year

26
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,271
just to pay the air conditioning bills

27
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,117
for those wars.

28
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,235
And that's what war is really about.

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,990
War is an economy.

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,359
Anybody who tells you otherwise

31
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,954
is either in on it or stupid.

32
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,472
But I didn't know that yet.

33
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,713
Back then, I didn't know anything.

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,918
You can't park here.

35
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,758
Uh...

36
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,993
Hey, man. I just got
a client at 2150, Mr. Shore.

37
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,834
I'm a few minutes early.

38
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,156
Yeah? It's a gated community.

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,514
You still can't park here.

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,389
You probably shouldn't
smoke that here, either.

41
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,188
Okay. Thanks.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,467
There's a lot I could say
about this period in my life

43
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,830
that would give context to this story.

44
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,399
I could tell you how

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,430
I dropped out of college
after one semester.

46
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,918
- How's that left quad doing?
- It's still sore.

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,468
Had a falling out with my parents.

48
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,716
How I either quit or got fired
from six different jobs.

49
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,514
- That's it.
- All right. There we go.

50
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,473
But looking back

51
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,314
I think the most important
thing to understand is

52
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,389
I was completely lost.

53
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,879
Sorry. It fell.

54
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,872
That's okay, Gary.

55
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,439
I was 22 years old

56
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,713
massaging rich dudes in Miami Beach
for 75 bucks an hour.

57
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,312
But I'd had enough.

58
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,795
It was time to change shit up.

59
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,350
And I had a big idea.

60
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,393
My plan was to sell
quality bed sheets wholesale

61
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,511
to all the retirement homes
in South Florida.

62
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,358
And there were hundreds of them.

63
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,600
- It feels really soft.
- It should.

64
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,074
It's Egyptian cotton, 400 thread count.

65
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,999
I mean, it's pretty much top of the line
for institutional use.

66
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,709
I don't know. It seems excessive.

67
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,396
Well, at $29 per unit,
it's far from excessive.

68
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,559
David, do you know the average age
of a resident here at Hilldale?

69
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,035
Um, no, I don't.

70
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,435
- Eighty-two years old.
- Wow.

71
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,834
Have you ever seen the skin
on an 82-year-old man?

72
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,156
Have you ever felt it?

73
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,319
Yeah. Actually,
I'm a certified massage therapist

74
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,112
and a lot of my clients are elderly.

75
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,394
Then you should know.

76
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,398
These sheets,

77
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,069
it would be like wrapping
a lizard in cashmere.

78
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,959
Would you do that?

79
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,158
Would you wrap a lizard in cashmere?

80
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,555
I guess not.

81
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,115
Then why would you expect me to?

82
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,235
My nephew.

83
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,273
He's good, right?

84
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,196
I'd sunk my entire life savings
into 65 cases of premium bed sheets

85
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,867
but I overlooked one crucial factor.

86
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,634
No one really cares about old people.

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,470
Why don't you just sell them back?

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
It doesn't work like that.
I bought them in bulk.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,512
I'm so fucked.

90
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,153
You're not fucked.

91
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,997
Pete's fucked.

92
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,476
He's dead.

93
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,954
Holy shit. Is that Efraim?

94
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,427
Yeah.

95
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,036
I thought he was still in LA.

96
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,915
Me too.

97
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,718
- He was a great friend.
- Thank you.

98
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,192
He looks so tan.

99
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,590
Efraim Diveroli
was my best friend growing up.

100
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,630
But I hadn't seen him
since he was shipped off

101
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,795
to live with his uncle in 10th grade.

102
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,149
I think our parents wanted to keep us
as far apart as possible.

103
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,355
There is no table of contents
in the Book of Life.

104
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,754
We don't know if we're at the beginning
of a new chapter, or the end of a story.

105
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,437
Which is why we must be grateful

106
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,834
every time the page turns.

107
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,238
Did you come back just for this?

108
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,749
Fuck no! I barely knew Pete.

109
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,836
I was hoping to see you here.

110
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,995
You know your mom
wouldn't give me your number?

111
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,319
What, did you call my house?

112
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,714
No, I was fucking her.

113
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,831
She still hates me, huh?

114
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,473
Yeah, most likely.

115
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,192
I missed you, bro.

116
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,509
Yeah, me too.

117
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,637
Let's go for a ride.

118
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,915
Uh...

119
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,996
I can't. I got a client at 4:00.

120
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,878
Fuck that shit. Cancel it.

121
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,638
Your boy's back in town.

122
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,158
Come on!

123
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,096
So, what happened with LA, man?

124
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Why did you move back?

125
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,191
Oh, you know I was working
for my uncle, right?

126
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,960
Yeah, I heard that you were, like,
a gun dealer or something.

127
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Pretty much. I mean,

128
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,635
we'd buy seized weapons at police auctions
and resell them on the Internet.

129
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Cool.

130
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,788
It was cool until my uncle
scumbagged me over 70 grand.

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,751
Holy shit. Seventy grand?

132
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,793
Whatever. Fuck him.
I made a bunch of money.

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,878
I decided I'd come back to Miami,
start up my own shop.

134
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,307
Cool.

135
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,798
Yo, where's this guy live?

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,440
It's, like, five more minutes.
You got somewhere you gotta be?

137
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,875
No.

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,394
All right. So, I can't figure out
which is worse.

139
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,794
The fact that you sell
bed sheets to old age homes

140
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,631
or that you jerk guys off for money.

141
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,309
For the record,
I'm a licensed massage therapist, okay?

142
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,838
Totally legit.

143
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,236
Okay. But at the end,
the guys have to come, right?

144
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,873
Like, on your chest or whatever?

145
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,071
You know what? Fuck you.

146
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,076
Fuck you, buddy.

147
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,033
Bro, do you remember the last time
we went to buy weed together?

148
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,275
Of course I do. It was fucking traumatic.

149
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,120
Yeah, but do you remember the next day,
when we walked into school

150
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,196
and everybody knew that we got arrested?

151
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,311
Yeah, we were gangsters, bro.

152
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,828
We thought we ran South Beach.

153
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,836
We did run yeshiva.

154
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,836
We didn't take shit from anyone.

155
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,634
Yeah, I miss that.

156
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,115
You miss yeshiva?

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,116
No, I miss

158
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,510
not taking shit from anyone.

159
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,399
Yo!

160
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,673
He out. You looking for weed?

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,190
Depends. You got good shit?

162
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,351
Put it this way. I sell him his shit.

163
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,631
What's up with this nigga, man?

164
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,273
Cool. Can you do an ounce?

165
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,754
Yeah, no sweat. Three bills.

166
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,198
Three hundred. I like it.

167
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:45,895
You get the better price
when you come direct to the distributor.

168
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,352
I guess so.

169
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,674
All right.

170
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,536
Yeah, so, she opened the door.

171
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,495
And I'm like, "Yo. Chill.
I ain't about that drama."

172
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,519
You know what I mean?

173
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,056
"I know you got
another nigga in the crib."

174
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,195
What's up?

175
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
What?

176
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,273
Can I get the shit?

177
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,798
What shit?

178
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,589
I just gave you $300 for some weed.

179
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,192
Any of you niggas ever
seen this motherfucker before?

180
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,554
I ain't seen shit.

181
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,191
Man, get the fuck out of here.

182
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,153
- All right. All right, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

183
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,229
This white bo wild.

184
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,713
Parachute pants.

185
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,519
Looking like Jay Leno and shit.

186
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,480
Look like he going to church.

187
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,038
Yo, yo, hold up, hold up, man.

188
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
- What the fuck.
- Shit!

189
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,868
Come on! Where's everybody going?

190
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,911
I thought we were gonna hang out.

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,513
What a bunch of assholes.

192
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,477
What the fuck was that? Are you crazy?

193
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,639
It's cool, bro.

194
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,440
I have a Class 3 Firearms license.

195
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,518
- Huh?
- Come on, get in.

196
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,357
I know another dealer nearby.

197
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,274
It's weird. We were the same age,
but I always looked up to Efraim.

198
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,713
When life kicked me, I stayed down.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,072
But not Efraim. He kicked back.

200
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,110
Mr. President, we want to thank you

201
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,719
for visiting us here today.

202
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,195
We are honored to be serving our country,

203
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,032
and proud to welcome you,

204
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,434
our wartime Commander in Chief...

205
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,750
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetie.

206
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,599
How was the funeral?

207
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,630
It was amazing.

208
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,677
Oh, my God. You're so stoned, aren't you?

209
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,437
Huh? What?

210
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,234
You just described a funeral as "amazing."

211
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,715
What? No. The funeral was really sad.

212
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,870
Yeah, everyone was totally bummed out.

213
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,389
But I ran into my friend from growing up.

214
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,830
The guy I told you about. Efraim Diveroli?

215
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,638
The one you got arrested with?

216
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,316
Yeah. I mean, we did
some other stuff too, but...

217
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,710
Anyway, he just moved back to Miami.

218
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,273
That's great, right?

219
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,988
Yeah. I'm supposed
to swing by his office tomorrow.

220
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,758
We're gonna grab lunch.

221
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,312
- Okay.
- Are you hungry?

222
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,748
- Hmm?
- I'm so hungry.

223
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,629
- We don't have much here.
- Oh.

224
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,990
- I mean, we have pizza.
- Really?

225
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,912
- And nachos.
- We have nachos?

226
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,717
And ice cream.

227
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,195
Wait, what? We never have ice cream.

228
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,037
You're fucking with me, aren't you?

229
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,919
That is so mean.

230
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,239
That was so easy.

231
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Hello?

232
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,959
Hello, Mr. Borstein.
This is David Packouz.

233
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,673
You told me to call today at 11:00.

234
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,509
I have those bed sheets with me,
and I would love for you to take a look.

235
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,273
Uh, sir, if you give me the chance

236
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,356
I am confident that your residents

237
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,958
will appreciate the difference.

238
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,908
It's an expense we can't justify,
and we're just not interested.

239
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,354
Uh-huh.

240
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,750
Okay, well, thank you for your time.

241
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,255
Yeah, this is contract specialist

242
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,793
Lindsey Michaels
from Army Command, Picatinny.

243
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,558
That's right.

244
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,878
Yeah, I sent out a solicitation
for some 249s for Basra

245
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,434
and we seem to have
misplaced your paperwork.

246
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,816
Great. So if you can go ahead
and just re-email me those numbers.

247
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,034
Actually, you know what?
On second thought,

248
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,000
we're about to make
a decision on those RFPs.

249
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,000
Why don't you go ahead
and just give me your bid

250
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,355
while I got you here on the phone?

251
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,434
Uh-huh.

252
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,232
And does that include mags?

253
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,076
Great. Yes, sir.

254
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,187
You keep supplying the guns,
we'll keep killing the bad guys.

255
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,273
God bless you.

256
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,958
What a fucking tool. What's up, bro?

257
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,355
Yo, what's up, man?
What was that all about?

258
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,669
Oh, that was me
impersonating an army officer.

259
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,677
Really? What for?

260
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,039
To find out what my competitor's
bidding on a contract.

261
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,038
It's fucking genius.

262
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,600
I thought that you said you sold,

263
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,676
like, seized weapons
to gun nuts on the Internet.

264
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,995
Not anymore.

265
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,957
Now I only sell to one gun nut.

266
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,519
Oh, yeah? Which one?

267
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,471
The U.S. Military, motherfucker.

268
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,998
Wanna do a bong hit?

269
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,594
Pretty sick, huh?

270
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,188
So what, you sell these things
to the Pentagon?

271
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,754
I sell all kinds of shit to the Pentagon.

272
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,712
Guns, bullets, body armor.

273
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:11,356
Last week, I shipped 400 gas masks
to American Special Forces in Iraq.

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,869
No shit.

275
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,510
How long you been doing this for?

276
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,232
Two, three months.

277
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,395
And you make good money?

278
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,716
Oh! Fuck, man.

279
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,712
Put it this way.
I did over 200K in the past eight weeks.

280
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,200
And I'm only telling you that
because you're my boy.

281
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,475
I'm not bragging.

282
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,072
Holy shit.

283
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,712
Yeah. Check this out.

284
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,437
Fed Biz Opps stands for
Federal Business Opportunities.

285
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,755
Think eBay, but for war.

286
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,919
- They buy tanks on here?
- Bro, they buy everything on here.

287
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,519
It was crazy.

288
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,790
The government had a public website

289
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,436
containing every military contract
currently up for bidding.

290
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,240
But I skip the big ticket items,
and look for the small-ball shit

291
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,590
that giant defense contractors ignore.

292
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:00,109
Everybody's fighting over the same pie.

293
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,832
But they're ignoring the crumbs.

294
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,469
I live on crumbs, like a rat.

295
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,316
And when you're dealing with the Pentagon,
crumbs are worth millions.

296
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,308
These listings
seemed to go on forever.

297
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,233
And according to Efraim, they did.

298
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,391
Thanks, man.

299
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,229
So, I don't get it.

300
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,077
If there's an entire defense industry,

301
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,113
why would the Pentagon
want to buy anything from you?

302
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,919
They don't want to, they have to.

303
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,519
Remember Little League?

304
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,593
How, at the end of the season,
they'd give out that big MVP trophy

305
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,279
and that one kid would always win it?

306
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,634
Yeah, Evan Talbot.

307
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,273
Right. But then, one year,
somebody's mom complained?

308
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,789
Then they had to give everybody
a little trophy so they wouldn't feel bad?

309
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,792
Even that fat retarded kid,
Robbie Friedman, got one.

310
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,990
That's kind of like what's happening here.

311
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,271
I'm still confused, man.

312
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,631
The Pentagon fucked up
when they were rebuilding the Iraqi Army.

313
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,998
They gave all these no-bid contracts
to Cheney's boys, and they got caught.

314
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,673
So Bush started this initiative
to level the playing field

315
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,309
and now every Pentagon purchase,
every gun, every grenade,

316
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,234
every bullet, gets offered to
small businesses for bidding.

317
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,317
And sure, the big dogs
still get the big trophies.

318
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,835
But the Pentagon's
got to give little trophies

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,468
to all the Robbie Friedmans of the world.

320
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,715
So, basically, you're a fat retarded kid.

321
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,554
Bro, I'm the fattest and most retarded.

322
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,480
In a speech today,

323
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,556
President Bush said that
contrary to reports

324
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,672
he has no plans to attack Iran.

325
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,736
The President said, "That's ridiculous.

326
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,068
"We didn't even have plans
when we attacked Iraq."

327
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,148
David.

328
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,519
Yeah?

329
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,875
Remember a few weeks ago, in the car
on the way home from my mom's house?

330
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,355
Yes. Yes, I do.

331
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,473
Well, this happened.

332
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,153
How the fuck
are you going to feed a baby?

333
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,157
Have you even thought about this?

334
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,359
What are you going to do?

335
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,073
Jerk men off the rest of your life?

336
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:15,828
Yeah, that's the plan.
I'm gonna feed my kid by jerking men off.

337
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,555
Sorry.

338
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,759
Okay, good. Well, at least
you thought it through.

339
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,432
It's not funny.

340
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,588
Dude, I am so fucked.

341
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,915
I think you should come work for me.

342
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,877
What are you talking about?

343
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,990
Seriously, I need the help.

344
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,315
David, look at me.

345
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,155
Bush opened the floodgates in Iraq.

346
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,198
It's a fucking gold rush.

347
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,159
That's really nice of you, Efraim.

348
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,191
Fuck nice! Who cares about nice?

349
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,536
I've been looking to bring
somebody on for a while now.

350
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,028
The problem is, I don't trust anyone.

351
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,518
But you're my boy.

352
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,115
I mean, no offense,
but I'm against this war.

353
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:03,028
Me and Iz are going to rallies
and signing petitions.

354
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,877
Yeah, dude, I'm against the war too.

355
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,593
I fucking hate Bush.

356
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,192
But this isn't about being pro-war.

357
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,435
The war is happening.

358
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,675
This is about being pro-money.

359
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,758
The more Efraim talked,
the more it made sense.

360
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,915
Besides, compared to my other prospects,

361
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,474
this was the chance of a lifetime.

362
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,275
My only issue was, what would I tell Iz?

363
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,556
I think it's a great idea.

364
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,553
So I lied.

365
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,512
You know I've always
believed in this business.

366
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,759
I told her that Efraim
had great contacts in the government.

367
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,472
And instead of selling bed sheets

368
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,796
to penny-pinching retirement homes

369
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,468
we'd now be selling sheets
to the free-spending,

370
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,756
overfunded U.S. Military.

371
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,518
It's genius.

372
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,757
I had to lie. Iz hated the war.

373
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,952
She had two cousins serving in Iraq.

374
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,512
She also hated the mountain of bed sheets
that were taking up half our apartment.

375
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,192
I spent the next six weeks
in a crash course on arms dealing.

376
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,310
The Herstal 556 light machine gun.

377
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,714
Belgian, but made under license
in lots of places.

378
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,712
When it came to this shit,
Efraim knew everything.

379
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,076
Makes, models, weights, where it was made.

380
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,135
Remember, there's been an arms embargo
against China since Tiananmen Square.

381
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,895
And if there was
an angle to be played,

382
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,068
he knew about that too.

383
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,349
You have to read between
the lines with this stuff.

384
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,160
All the money is made between the lines.

385
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,319
I'd spend my entire day
scouring the government's website,

386
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,148
searching for overlooked contracts
that we could squeeze our way into.

387
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,551
Hey, I think I got something.

388
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,758
Hey, Georgia, I gotta call you back.

389
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,576
And then,
in the middle of the night

390
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,829
we'd be back in the office,
working the phones.

391
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,348
Forging relationships

392
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:56,950
with weapon manufacturers
all over Eastern Europe.

393
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,753
No, David Packouz from AEY.

394
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,877
I told Iz we were doing conference calls
with sheet suppliers in Pakistan.

395
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,230
They called guys like us war dogs.

396
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,670
Bottom feeders who make money off of war

397
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,075
without ever stepping foot
on the battlefield.

398
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,150
It was meant to be derogatory,
but we kinda liked it.

399
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,113
You fucking scumbag piece of shit!

400
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:24,471
Drown, motherfucker, drown!

401
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,028
Very nice.

402
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,670
Ralph Slutsky
was Efraim's silent partner.

403
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,558
He was a local businessman

404
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,797
who owned 14 dry cleaners
all across Miami.

405
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,917
Why didn't anybody tell me
the mister is broken?

406
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,916
Ralph put up the money to back the deals
in exchange for 25% of the company.

407
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,315
Or at least what he thought was 25%.

408
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,790
We're doing God's work, Ralph.

409
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,797
We really are.

410
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,036
You know, every Jew owes a debt to Israel.

411
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,834
In my mind, this is not
a metaphorical debt.

412
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,296
Ralph was under the impression

413
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,196
that Efraim was an observant Jew

414
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,838
who only dealt arms as a means

415
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,951
to protect Israel from her enemies.

416
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,791
Beautifully said.

417
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,434
Did you happen to catch
last Friday's T orah portion?

418
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,273
- One of my favorites.
- Same here.

419
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,074
It reminds me so much
of this story I once read.

420
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,952
About a young man traveling to Pinsk.

421
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,634
And that was Efraim's genius.

422
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,190
He would figure out
who someone wanted him to be

423
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,278
and he would become that person.

424
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,634
Ah!

425
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,429
And he's got, like, 20,000 of them.

426
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,319
Great.
Where did you find this guy?

427
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,556
You remember Victor in the Ukraine?

428
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,200
Yeah, the one with the Mk3s?

429
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,192
Yeah. He turned me
on to this company in Cyprus.

430
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,788
It's run by this guy, Henry Girard.

431
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,068
Henry Girard?

432
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,433
Yeah, you know him?

433
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,711
You spoke to Henry Girard?

434
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,154
A couple of times. Why? Who is he?

435
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,875
Dude, for the last 20 years,
this guy has basically supplied

436
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,434
both sides of every conflict
on the planet.

437
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,153
He's a fucking animal.

438
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,032
Really? Why is he calling me?

439
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,116
Because he's a fucking animal.

440
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,159
It's all money and it all matters.

441
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,112
Hey, mami, where are you going?

442
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,352
I'm trying to find my friends.

443
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,874
You want to make some money?

444
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Excuse me?

445
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,835
I'll give you $1,000 right now

446
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,916
if we fast forward to our third date.

447
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,679
What does that even mean?

448
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,236
It means we just had a great dinner,
maybe met your friends for some drinks

449
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,237
and now you're about to blow me in my car.

450
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,839
Can we just get right to that part?

451
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,439
Who the fuck are you?

452
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,992
Efraim Diveroli.

453
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,359
That's my best friend, David.

454
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,072
And we're international arms dealers.

455
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,394
But you already know that

456
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,396
because we're on our third date.

457
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,112
- What's going on?
- Nothing, bro.

458
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm about to get out of here with my girl.

459
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,672
What the fuck, man!

460
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,351
Oh, my God.

461
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,351
That guy was not fucking around.

462
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,759
Yeah, you probably should have
picked a different girl.

463
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,513
Fuck that, it almost worked.

464
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,430
Hey, do you remember when you fought
Eric Moscowitz in sixth grade?

465
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,035
Yeah, he did that windmill thing
with his arms.

466
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,195
That was the sickest. He was unbeatable.

467
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,878
You remember that shit?

468
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,113
That's it.

469
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,359
Dude, he would have killed me
if you didn't jump in.

470
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,518
Probably. Mmm.

471
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,673
Hey, I never said "thank you."

472
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,912
For everything.

473
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,359
Come on, you know how much
you've helped me out lately.

474
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,592
It's cool. You don't have to
make it weird, all right?

475
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,117
Hey, can we order some food?

476
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,519
Mami, come on.
I could have gone to Cuba and back.

477
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,557
Met the family,
grabbed a couple sandwiches.

478
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,256
I'd be done by now.

479
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,279
Hello?

480
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,310
Yes, sir. Sorry, I wasn't expecting
a work call this late.

481
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:11,079
Right, of course.
It's 9:00 a.m. in Baghdad.

482
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Who is it?

483
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,109
That's great news, Captain Santos.

484
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,513
Yes, sir.

485
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,079
We're going to get right on that.

486
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,229
Thank you. Bye.

487
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
What?

488
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,319
We just got the Beretta deal.

489
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,753
Get the fuck out of here.

490
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,269
I swear to God.

491
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,351
The Beretta deal was massive.

492
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,347
It was 10 times bigger
than anything we'd closed so far.

493
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,550
This was next level shit.

494
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:39,397
That's what I'm fucking talking about!

495
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,954
That's real money, motherfucker! Fuck!

496
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,357
Do you realize we're going to make 600K

497
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,878
on this fucking thing?

498
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,119
Holy shit.

499
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:51,074
David, your 30% is $180,000.

500
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,391
Holy fucking shit!

501
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,107
It was amazing.

502
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,000
I'd been working with Efraim
for two months

503
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,150
and was already about to make more money

504
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,112
than a lifetime of massages.

505
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,868
Listen.

506
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,193
What is that?

507
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,279
That's your baby's heartbeat.

508
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,795
Wow.

509
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,230
Can you believe how fast it is?

510
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,316
- Is that normal?
- Totally normal.

511
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,478
Fetuses have a much faster heart rate
than we do.

512
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,388
Look.

513
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,269
So, you guys want to know the sex?

514
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,518
We keep going back and forth on it.

515
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,070
- What do you think?
- Um...

516
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,997
This is work. I have to take it.

517
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,269
I'm so sorry.

518
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,634
This is David.

519
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,636
This is Captain Santos in Baghdad

520
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,990
checking on the delivery
status of my Berettas.

521
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,912
Captain, good to hear from you.

522
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,276
Yes, we are on target. All good.

523
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,948
Great. I was worried

524
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,588
those guns were coming
direct out of Italy.

525
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,869
Absolutely. They are, sir.

526
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,070
Packouz, please tell me

527
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,919
you're aware of the legislation
the Italians passed last week.

528
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,788
The one banning
all arms shipments to Iraq.

529
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,919
I had no clue
what he was talking about.

530
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,838
But this was a huge fucking problem.

531
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,877
Berettas are an Italian gun.

532
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,877
Made and manufactured in Italy.

533
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,108
Uh...

534
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,634
Of course.

535
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,239
I am. I've been on the phone

536
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
for the last three days,
making other arrangements.

537
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,272
Great.
That's what I wanted to hear.

538
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,913
Iraqi police force is depending on you.

539
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:46,349
Well, you tell them AEY
has got them covered.

540
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,278
- Outstanding.
- Thanks, Captain. Talk soon.

541
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,078
Everything okay?

542
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,469
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

543
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,198
What happened? We done already?

544
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,073
Yeah. Guess what?

545
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,873
It's a girl.

546
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,108
Baby.

547
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,712
Okay. At least I hit something.

548
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,830
Seriously, what the fuck
are we going to do?

549
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,798
Relax, bro.

550
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,234
Should I just call him back
and tell him the truth?

551
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:38,479
When does telling the truth
ever help anybody?

552
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,635
Efraim, we can't dick around with this guy

553
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,914
and then not deliver.

554
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,554
We're going to deliver.
I already figured it out.

555
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,835
We use Jordan.

556
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,753
Jordan Goldfarb?

557
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Jordan...

558
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,512
Jordan the country.

559
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,150
It shares a border with Iraq.
It's a U.S. ally.

560
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,953
And most importantly, there's no embargo.

561
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,116
Okay, so what do we tell the Italians?

562
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,116
Fuck them! As far as they're concerned

563
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,590
they're sending 5,000 Berettas
to a country they have no issue with.

564
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,075
All we have to do is ship the guns

565
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,991
from Jordan to Baghdad.

566
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,638
It's called circumvention.

567
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Is that legal?

568
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,473
It's not illegal.

569
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,749
Want to try?

570
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,576
How did that charity thing go?

571
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,919
It was 5K, right?

572
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,758
It was supposed to be a 5K.

573
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,996
Uh, I finished about 1 K of it.

574
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,319
So, I should probably return
four-fifths of the money.

575
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,837
So, Andrew told me

576
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,348
you and Efraim are working together now?

577
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Really?

578
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,957
Yeah, I told her about the sheet thing.

579
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,635
Yeah. Efraim has some contacts
with the government.

580
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:45,876
So we're just combining forces right now.

581
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,388
Yeah, just... Just be careful with him.

582
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,556
- Emily, don't.
- What?

583
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,988
How do you mean?

584
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,878
Well, his cousin, Rebecca,
is an old friend of mine.

585
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,439
We went to camp together.

586
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,996
And she told me
that he stole $70,000 from her father.

587
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,712
Whoa, really?

588
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
That's interesting.

589
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,920
I actually heard
it was the other way around.

590
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,554
That his uncle is the one
who stole the money from him.

591
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,028
See? You don't know.

592
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,776
Everyone has their own version of a story.

593
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,313
No, I'm pretty certain.

594
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,480
Their whole family
stopped talking to him over it.

595
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,438
Yo! Why aren't you answering your phone?

596
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,278
Hey, what's up, man?

597
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Fuck is this?

598
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,477
Everyone, this is David's
business partner, Efraim.

599
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,830
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

600
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,839
Bro, could I talk to you
outside for a minute?

601
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,393
- It's urgent.
- Yeah, of course.

602
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,434
And for the record,
I'm also his best friend,

603
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,153
so probably should have been
invited to whatever this is.

604
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:43,432
Look, these are her friends.
This is her dinner party.

605
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,756
Rosen is her friend now? That Jew fuck?

606
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,415
Trust me, you don't want to be here.

607
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,839
I don't want to be here, all right?

608
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,519
Now, what's going on?

609
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:52,432
Jordanian customs seized our Berettas.

610
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,951
- What? Why?
- I don't fucking know, David.

611
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,279
I dropped out of high school

612
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,079
before they covered
international diplomacy.

613
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,749
- Who's that?
- Fuck, it's Santos.

614
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,994
He knows!

615
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,993
Pick it up, I want to listen.

616
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,634
- Pick... Pick up the fucking phone.
- This is David.

617
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,375
Yeah, I just heard
my guns are being held up in Jordan.

618
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,357
Captain Santos, yes,
there's been a slight hiccup.

619
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,960
What are they even doing in Jordan?

620
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,119
Not to worry.

621
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,674
They're in a hangar in Amman.
Totally safe.

622
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,559
My team and I are working
on a solution right now.

623
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:24,272
You didn't answer my question.

624
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,277
What the fuck are my guns doing in Jordan?

625
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,230
Captain Santos, this is Efraim Diveroli.

626
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,077
President of AEY, sir.

627
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,776
David has apprised me of the situation

628
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,455
and we are looking at options as we speak.

629
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,708
Options? What kind of options?

630
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,878
Well, are you familiar
with the Corvus TP1 9?

631
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,036
That's Brazilian and it's shit.

632
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,470
Contract says Berettas, I want Berettas.

633
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,750
Sir, I need you to work
with us a little on this.

634
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Let me get this straight.

635
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,479
I'm in the ass crack of the world,
defending your freedom.

636
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,590
And I got to work with you shit bags?

637
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,039
Look, I don't know

638
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,555
if those Berettas are really in Amman

639
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,336
or if you're just trying
to goose your profits

640
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,557
like every other piece of shit
in your miserable, rat-fuck profession.

641
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,354
Either way, you're endangering my mission.

642
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,595
I'm shutting you down.

643
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,471
I'm canceling you for cause.

644
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,232
Getting canceled for cause
was a death sentence.

645
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,039
It meant we would never
win another contract.

646
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,758
Captain, please do not do that.

647
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,719
I know you're upset.

648
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,830
But from one Christian to another

649
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,116
my wife and I are having
serious financial problems.

650
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,357
Our son, Lucas, is in the hospital.

651
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,755
Medical bills are through the roof.

652
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,192
If you do this, it'll ruin me.
It'll ruin my family.

653
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,509
As God as my witness,

654
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,635
I will get you your guns.

655
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:44,839
Hello?

656
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,920
What a fucking piece of shit!
Do you believe this fucking guy?

657
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,228
- Fuck.
- What's going on?

658
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,718
What guns, David?

659
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,431
Are you fucking kidding me?

660
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,188
You told me you guys
were selling bed sheets.

661
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,198
Yeah, and I also told you
that we're selling other stuff too.

662
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,152
I thought you meant pillows!

663
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,360
Look, I can't support a kid
by giving massages.

664
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:12,356
Okay? And nobody
was buying the bed sheets.

665
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,152
No, David, you lied to me.

666
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,436
Because I know how you feel about the war.

667
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,550
I thought we both felt that way!

668
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,157
I'm five months pregnant!

669
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,237
And it's a problem
if I can't trust the man

670
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,509
I'm having a baby with!

671
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,835
- Of course you can trust me.
- Really?

672
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,079
Because five minutes ago,

673
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,960
I didn't even know
you were an arms dealer!

674
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,592
I'm not an arms dealer.

675
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,318
What we do is perfectly legal.

676
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,755
We work for the government.
We're middlemen.

677
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,155
We don't touch the guns,
we don't see the guns.

678
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,635
We never even leave the office.

679
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,599
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
It's time sensitive.

680
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,880
David, do you have a passport?

681
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,516
What? Yeah, why?

682
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,949
We have to go to Jordan. Like, ASAP.

683
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,559
Straighten this shit out.

684
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,193
We gotta talk, whatever, okay?

685
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,588
Yeah.

686
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,030
Yo, you window or aisle?

687
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,030
- Excuse me, sorry.
- Yeah, we just landed.

688
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,039
- Excuse me.
- The Embassy call?

689
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,719
Excuse me. Okay, bye.

690
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,038
- Sorry, kind of an emergency.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

691
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,039
Don't worry, I have to go first.
I'm American.

692
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,309
I'm sorry.

693
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,135
The American Embassy
offered little to no help

694
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,628
in dealing with the Ministry of Customs.

695
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,876
So we took matters into our own hands.

696
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,717
He says your permit has expired

697
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,393
and that you can't fly your crates
out of Jordan without one.

698
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,192
Yeah, we know. That's why we're here.

699
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,070
Look, we were told that
you know people in the government,

700
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,152
that maybe you can help us out.

701
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:11,152
<b><i>Psagmeno.com
 No1 Subs iNFO</i></b>

702
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,960
He says it will take six weeks
to get a new permit.

703
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,039
Yeah, that's the issue.
We don't have six weeks.

704
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,757
We need our guns today.

705
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,398
Look, I don't want to come off
as the ugly American here.

706
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,148
And maybe I don't understand
the rituals of your culture

707
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,679
but this feels like the moment

708
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,079
where we are supposed to offer
him a gift, am I correct?

709
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,757
- You are correct.
- All right.

710
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,349
$1,400 U.S. Cool?

711
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,349
Cool, man.

712
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:47,672
Could have just started with that,
you know, saved all this bullshit.

713
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
I like your shades.

714
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,936
Tell him I'll give him
100 bucks for those shades.

715
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,153
Tell him in gibberish.

716
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,958
No way. Alligator.

717
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,036
Yeah, I know. I...

718
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,793
It's Lacoste. It's actually a crocodile.

719
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,952
I like fancy shit, that's my thing.

720
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,599
Tell him.

721
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,072
For three days,
we didn't hear anything.

722
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,233
It was ridiculous.

723
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,512
Our entire business was riding on the word
of an 11-year-old translator.

724
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,431
Motherfucker! He ripped us off!

725
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,798
We don't know that yet.

726
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,195
No! I know what it feels like
to fuck somebody.

727
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,639
I also know what it feels like
to get fucked by somebody.

728
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,239
And we just got fucked.

729
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,875
You need to chill out.

730
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,711
How am I supposed to chill out, David?

731
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,228
We're in a Muslim country,
I can't even get a blowjob!

732
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,992
It's embarrassing!

733
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,148
It's chaos here! Fuck!

734
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,199
Yeah.

735
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Right now?

736
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,512
We're coming down.

737
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,280
That was Aladdin. They're in the lobby.

738
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,710
See that? Come on.

739
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:07,068
Hold on. Are you fucking kidding me?

740
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
What's the problem?

741
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,876
You wanted your guns back,
he got you your guns back.

742
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,389
What? No, we said we needed a permit
to fly them to Iraq.

743
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,070
Exactly, but you don't need
a permit to drive them.

744
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,592
You expect us to drive them to Iraq?

745
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,072
Why not? Marlboro is the best
smuggler in all of Jordan.

746
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,559
Who, this?

747
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,393
This is the best smuggler
in all of Jordan?

748
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,713
Yeah, he drives to Baghdad
three, four times a month.

749
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,193
Efraim, you want to weigh in here?

750
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,396
Yo, how far is it to Baghdad?

751
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,440
- Why are you asking him that?
- 800 kilometers.

752
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,880
And he knows what he's doing?

753
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,434
Efraim, stop.

754
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,596
- 100% the best.
- Come on.

755
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,672
It's like 500 miles.
We'll be there by morning.

756
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,347
You seriously want to drive to Baghdad?

757
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,318
David, we're gunrunners.

758
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,313
Let's go run some fucking guns.

759
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,949
Let's go.

760
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,753
Come on.

761
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:15,349
Hey, seriously, is this safe?
Driving to Baghdad?

762
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,516
Yes, very safe.

763
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,755
50-50.

764
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,548
50-50? What, like 50% we live, 50% we die?

765
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,592
Yes. That is why we drive through night.

766
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,833
It is much safer.

767
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,233
How much safer?

768
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,708
50-50.

769
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,318
Bro, what the fuck!

770
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:38,472
Obviously, he doesn't know
what 50-50 means.

771
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,079
Oh, my God.

772
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,117
Hey, what about gas though?
It's a long trip, no?

773
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,478
No problem. Petrol free in Iraq.

774
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,153
No kidding.

775
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,913
- Free gas?
- Yeah.

776
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,231
See what I'm talking about? Iraq is dope.

777
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,115
I'm thinking about getting a place there.

778
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,068
Free gas.

779
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,356
Fucking cool, man.

780
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,989
What is that?

781
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
What?

782
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,393
You don't see that?

783
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,913
What the fuck?

784
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,800
Hey, why are you slowing down, man?

785
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,309
It's okay, it's okay.

786
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:42,195
What's okay?

787
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,992
Whoa, whoa. What the fuck, bro?

788
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,474
It's okay. Border.

789
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,079
What, this?

790
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,195
Fuck.

791
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,628
- Jesus.
- Put down.

792
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,989
- Huh?
- Put down.

793
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,474
Whoa, whoa.

794
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,519
Cigarettes.

795
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,672
For you.

796
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,389
Welcome.

797
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,271
It was fucking surreal.

798
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,152
Six months ago,
I was a massage therapist in Miami Beach.

799
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,318
And now, here I was,
driving a truckload of guns

800
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:17,713
through the Iraqi desert

801
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,195
with my best friend from junior high.

802
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,197
Marlboro?

803
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,398
Hey, Marlboro?

804
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Bro!

805
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,559
There's a dead body in the gas station!

806
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:18,755
What the fuck!

807
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,476
Where are we? Where's Marlboro?

808
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,976
Did you not hear what I just said?

809
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,376
There's a fucking dead body in there, man!

810
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,798
Yes, I heard you.

811
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,440
All right, we're in a war zone, bro.

812
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:30,231
There's dead bodies, relax.

813
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,431
All right, I gotta take a leak.

814
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:37,039
What?

815
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,519
Be careful.

816
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,108
I'm good, bro.
I know how to take a piss, all right?

817
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Shit.

818
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,880
Fuck.

819
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,036
- Hello?
- Hey.

820
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,431
Hey, babe, is everything okay?

821
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:35,639
Yeah.

822
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,432
What time is it there?

823
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,989
It's, uh, 7:30 in the morning.

824
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,672
Shit, did I wake you?

825
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,992
No, I'm just at the hotel.
We're about to have some breakfast.

826
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,554
Listen, I'm not saying I like it,

827
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,472
but I get why you're doing this.

828
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:54,195
You do?

829
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,313
This whole time I never thought
about what you must be going through.

830
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:59,356
All the pressure you're under.

831
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:03,431
It's just the lying that kills me.

832
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,431
It makes me feel like I'm in this alone.

833
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,554
No, you're not in this alone.

834
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:16,672
I need you to know
that you can tell me anything, David.

835
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,710
We're partners, remember?

836
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,719
David?

837
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,512
Yeah, I gotta call you right back.

838
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,416
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

839
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,655
I'm just going to call you
right back, okay?

840
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:29,679
I love you. Bye.

841
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,831
Efraim!

842
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,480
Efraim!

843
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,398
- What?
- Look!

844
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,876
Marlboro!

845
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,239
Fuck! What the fuck, bro.

846
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,713
Holy shit, they have guns, man!

847
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,148
I know!

848
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,474
Go, go! Come on.

849
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:54,635
What the fuck! It won't start!

850
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,335
Where the fuck is Marlboro?

851
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,429
- I got it!
- Go! Go!

852
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,228
No, no, no!

853
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,759
Wait, wait, wait!

854
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,871
Wait! No!

855
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,599
Run, motherfucker! Jump in!

856
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:30,233
Holy shit! They're getting
closer. Come on, man. Go!

857
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,873
Go, go!

858
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,114
Come on!

859
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,355
Are you kidding me?

860
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:45,596
We stopped for gas in Fallujah?

861
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,028
You cheap fuck!

862
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:49,914
Go!

863
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:51,800
Fuck you, Marlboro!

864
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,480
Fuck.

865
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,512
Fuck. Fuck.

866
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,358
We're gonna die!

867
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,715
You wanted to drive
to Baghdad, you asshole!

868
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,835
They're stopping.

869
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:10,235
What the fuck? Look.

870
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,038
Holy fuck, bro.

871
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,637
Oh, fuck! All right!

872
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,599
God bless Dick Cheney's America!

873
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,313
Look at this fucking place.
Oh, my God.

874
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:14,713
Excuse me, sir?

875
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,920
What?

876
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:19,639
There are some guys here to see you.

877
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,034
Some guys?

878
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,793
What kind of guys?

879
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,353
Hey, Marlboro!

880
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:29,590
Give us a smile, gorgeous.

881
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,827
Let me see those pearly yellows.

882
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,753
You're like an Iraqi Tom Selleck, bro.

883
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,358
You guys are AEY?

884
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,672
Yes, sir. David Packouz.

885
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,996
This is my colleague, Efraim Diveroli.

886
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,119
We spoke on the phone.

887
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,753
I remember.

888
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,159
You drove these?

889
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,951
Through the Triangle of Death?

890
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:03,556
Fucking A right we did.

891
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,956
Kip, take these boys over to the cage,
get them paid.

892
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:09,159
Right away, sir.

893
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,072
I was wrong about you two.

894
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,150
Great fucking job, boys.

895
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,358
Great fucking job.

896
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,791
Holy shit, the Triangle of Death, bro?

897
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,070
That's right.
That's the AEY guarantee, bitch.

898
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,590
We drive through all triangles,
including your mom's.

899
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,715
Hey, Kip, snap a photo of us, pal.

900
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
All right.

901
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:41,719
Ready?

902
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:45,068
- How's my hair?
- It's good, slicked back.

903
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,759
Thank you.

904
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,108
- Got you.
- Let me see it.

905
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,376
Helmut fucking Newton over here.

906
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,469
All right, man.

907
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,759
- Perfect.
- All right, all right.

908
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,512
Let's go get fucking paid.

909
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:02,793
Holy shit.

910
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,349
Crazy, right? $12.2 billion.

911
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:10,512
It's all seized
from the godfather himself.

912
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,028
You guys call
Saddam Hussein the godfather?

913
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,108
Look at all this cash, bro.
What would you call him?

914
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,833
$2.8 million.

915
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:21,875
- Just sign here.
- You got it.

916
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:29,275
We got a military escort
to the airport

917
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,034
and got the fuck out of Baghdad.

918
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,313
There was almost $3 million in cash

919
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:41,750
stuffed into our Army-issued duffel bags.

920
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,436
You might think
after barely surviving Iraq

921
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:49,833
that we 'd be done.

922
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:51,829
But you'd be wrong.

923
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,030
You see, the Beretta deal
put us on the map.

924
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,277
After that, we started killing it.

925
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,278
We bought matching Porsches.

926
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:11,028
We bought two apartments
in the same building.

927
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,878
Oh, my God.

928
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,039
Holy shit, bro.

929
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:27,235
Oh!

930
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,119
Whoo!

931
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:33,791
Ralph was so happy with his returns

932
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:35,916
that he increased his original investment

933
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,030
in AEY by $10 million.

934
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:46,079
That gave us enough capital
to pursue more deals

935
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,632
and expand the company.

936
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:50,076
Which is exactly what we did.

937
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,273
I cannot stress this enough.

938
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,793
You need to be scouring this website.

939
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,273
Day and night.

940
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,480
It is updated by the minute.

941
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,469
There are tens of thousands of
solicitations on this website.

942
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,032
Each one is 40 to 50 pages long.

943
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:18,909
If you see something interesting,

944
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,117
you bring it to me.

945
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,795
If you bring it to me,

946
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:27,077
I'll make you rich.

947
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,838
Fact, 18 months ago,

948
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:31,951
David here was jerking off guys for money.

949
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:34,509
Actually, that is not a fact.

950
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,193
That is absolutely a fact.

951
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,512
Now he drives a Porsche.

952
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,072
And that's all because of AEY.

953
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:44,389
Do you have any questions?

954
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,190
Um, I have a question.

955
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,235
What does AEY stand for?

956
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,119
What do you mean? Like morally?

957
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,231
No, I mean what do the letters mean?

958
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,311
That's fucking...

959
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,556
What does IBM stand for? Nothing.

960
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,795
It just... It just sounds professional.

961
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:08,673
Uh, actually, IBM stands for
International Business Machines.

962
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,074
What did you say?

963
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,635
IBM stands for
International Business Machines.

964
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,599
Get the fuck out of here.

965
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,670
I'm serious.
You're not going to work here.

966
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,398
Get the fuck out of my office,
you fucking nerd!

967
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Go!

968
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,597
And for the record,
AEY doesn't stand for anything.

969
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,436
Fuck! What a dick.

970
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:47,594
Does anybody else have any questions?

971
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,518
Sleep. I got her.

972
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:14,153
All right. All right.

973
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:17,519
Hi.

974
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,391
I know.

975
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:25,548
I know. It's okay.

976
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,199
Okay.

977
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,353
What?

978
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:57,592
360,000 SVD sniper rifles.

979
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,275
1,084,000 GP-30 grenades.

980
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,989
45,000 SKO aviation rockets.

981
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,713
The Pentagon's arming the Afghans
for the next 30 years.

982
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,831
They're building a whole army.

983
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,277
Wait, that's got to be a typo.

984
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:15,793
It's not.

985
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,271
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo?

986
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:23,630
Bro, these aren't crumbs.

987
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,114
This is the whole fucking pie.

988
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:37,199
Among defense contractors,

989
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,039
this would come to be known
as the Afghan deal.

990
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:42,070
It would be the biggest opportunity

991
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,032
AEY would ever see.

992
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:48,237
We had to go for it.

993
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,077
So, where do you go
to arm an entire country?

994
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,880
Vegas X is where
military and manufacturers

995
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,112
come together to unveil
the latest in warfare.

996
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,829
It's like Comic-Con with grenades.

997
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,628
Sure, most of these guys
didn't know who AEY was.

998
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,789
But we saw that as an advantage.

999
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:22,679
- You got your list?
- Got it.

1000
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,831
- You feel good?
- Yeah, I feel pretty good.

1001
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,335
You know, this is different
than doing business on the phone.

1002
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,215
When they look at us,
they're going to see two kids.

1003
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:30,496
So we have to show them our balls.

1004
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:31,519
Got it.

1005
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,480
We need to be fucking thugs,
you understand?

1006
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:34,719
Understood.

1007
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,949
All right, good. Let's kill this shit.

1008
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,315
But it was a complete disaster.

1009
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,994
We quickly learned that

1010
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,030
even if we could land the Afghan deal,

1011
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:52,554
it would be a logistical nightmare.

1012
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,228
Jerry, good to see you.

1013
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,440
To source a deal of this magnitude

1014
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,833
would mean piecing together

1015
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:00,873
multiple vendors
from all around the world.

1016
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,432
Whoa, whoa.

1017
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:03,719
Get out of here.

1018
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,672
It would require
dozens of shipping outfits

1019
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,233
and hundreds of permits.

1020
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,918
We need 100 million rounds.

1021
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,715
All that could be okay
for a major defense contractor.

1022
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,239
But not for us.

1023
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:19,956
Honestly, we were out of our league.

1024
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:46,630
Change $ 10,000.

1025
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:50,592
Any luck today?

1026
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:06,755
Efraim!

1027
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,800
What's up, bro?

1028
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,536
Where you been? Why aren't you
answering your phone?

1029
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:14,880
I'm with a prostitute. What's up?

1030
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,199
Okay, you need to get dressed
and come with me right now.

1031
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,271
All right, uh, give me

1032
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:21,594
38 minutes.

1033
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,110
Efraim, Henry Girard is down at the bar,
waiting for us.

1034
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,829
Get the fuck out of here.

1035
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,349
I'm dead serious.

1036
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,795
Shit.

1037
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:34,188
Okay.

1038
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:37,998
Henry Girard was a legend
among arms dealers.

1039
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:41,670
When they hung Saddam Hussein
for crimes against humanity

1040
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,353
it was said that Henry sold them the rope.

1041
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:45,815
Hey, Henry, sorry I'm late.

1042
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,335
This is my partner
I was telling you about.

1043
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,315
- Efraim Diveroli.
- Nice to meet you.

1044
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:51,152
It's an absolute pleasure.

1045
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,760
Henry has a dinner in 10 minutes,

1046
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,440
but I wanted you to hear this firsthand.

1047
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,956
I showed him the list and he can help.

1048
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:59,398
Great. With which part?

1049
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,679
All of it.

1050
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:02,559
He can fill the whole order.

1051
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,992
- The whole order?
- Mmm-hmm.

1052
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,632
Even the AK ammo?

1053
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,518
Not a problem.

1054
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,554
You do know it's
100 million rounds, right?

1055
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,677
Henry has contacts in Albania.

1056
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,355
Albania?

1057
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,536
They spent decades preparing
for a Western invasion that never came.

1058
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,356
That country is one giant arsenal.

1059
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,516
It's all just sitting there.

1060
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Tell him the best part.

1061
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:26,190
They're in the process of joining NATO,

1062
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,597
so they have to dispose of all
of their Soviet era weapons.

1063
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,036
They are literally dismantling it
and turning it into scrap.

1064
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,556
I can get most of the shit
for pennies on the dollar.

1065
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,559
Now, tell him the other best part.

1066
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,030
You're looking at the exclusive agent
for the whole fucking thing.

1067
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:45,117
This was the magic bullet.

1068
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:49,235
One supplier who could
fill the entire Afghan deal.

1069
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,715
This wouldn't just put us in contention.

1070
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,074
We might actually win this thing.

1071
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,028
Sorry, I have a question.

1072
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,400
Sure.

1073
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,192
With that kind of hookup

1074
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,280
why don't you just bid
on the contract yourself?

1075
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,920
Full disclosure?

1076
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,936
I'm barred from doing any business
with the U.S. government.

1077
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,074
I'm on a watch list.

1078
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:18,474
Like a terrorist watch list?

1079
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,795
Mmm-hmm.

1080
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,389
- Got it.
- Wait, what?

1081
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:24,079
Okay, how much for the AK ammo?

1082
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,469
- 10 cents a round.
- That's fucking amazing.

1083
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:27,719
And what about shipping?

1084
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,655
You can get Ilyushin 76
through Russian pilots.

1085
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:30,679
80K per flight.

1086
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,757
I'm sorry, you're on
a terrorist watch list?

1087
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:34,079
What the fuck!

1088
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,271
Do you work for Homeland Security?
Relax, bro.

1089
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:38,391
You two should probably talk this over.

1090
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:41,114
We will. But we are very interested.

1091
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,588
Good. My flight leaves
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

1092
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,791
I can't spend more than 48 hours
in this dump.

1093
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,907
That's what I always say.
Vegas is a two-day town.

1094
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,277
I was talking about America.

1095
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,951
We're talking exclusive access
to a stockpile

1096
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:03,514
of Soviet Bloc non-standard
weapons and ammo.

1097
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,351
That's going to win this deal for us.

1098
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:06,952
He's on a terrorist watch list!

1099
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:10,436
Whatever. People end up on that list
for bringing scissors onto an airplane!

1100
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,199
That's not why he's on the list.

1101
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,510
Look, the Pentagon wants
100 million rounds of AK-47 ammo

1102
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,148
in the middle of a worldwide shortage.

1103
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,519
Where do you think
they think that's going to come from?

1104
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:25,873
A bunch of shady motherfuckers
like that guy.

1105
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,476
This is the job.

1106
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,476
To do business with the people in places

1107
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:34,677
the U.S. government
can't do business with directly.

1108
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,998
It's as simple as that.

1109
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:39,635
Fuck!

1110
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,320
Hey, boys.

1111
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:04,159
So we discussed it,
and we'd like to move forward.

1112
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:06,391
Fantastic. Congratulations.

1113
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:08,760
- But we have to see the merchandise.
- Oh, of course.

1114
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,518
On site, in person.

1115
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,152
You guys ever been to Albania?

1116
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,878
Honestly, until last night

1117
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,976
I didn't even know it was
a real fucking country.

1118
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,557
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

1119
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:21,711
Come on in. I'll call my guy
and we'll set it up.

1120
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:27,596
Albania is a lot of things.

1121
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,989
But a beautiful place is not one of them.

1122
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,552
It took us three separate flights

1123
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,068
and 22 hours just to get there.

1124
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:37,559
Henry's people sent a driver

1125
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,239
to pick us up at the airport

1126
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,079
and the guy would not stop talking.

1127
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,032
I fall over, she revive me.

1128
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:48,518
But none of that diminished
Efraim's enthusiasm.

1129
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,909
He really believed
this could be the answer.

1130
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:22,592
Welcome, AEY.

1131
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,440
I am Yili Pinari,

1132
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:26,949
head of Albania's largest
military export company.

1133
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:29,434
Efraim Diveroli. Good to see you.

1134
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:34,119
This is my business associate,
David Packouz.

1135
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,952
- Glad to meet you.
- How you doing?

1136
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:37,635
Uh...

1137
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,273
Thank you for the sign.

1138
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,271
Oh. It's for you.

1139
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:44,318
Yes, I know.
I said thank you for the sign.

1140
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:48,759
So, show us what you got.

1141
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,472
What is this place?

1142
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:58,630
Storage for the Albanian army.

1143
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,117
We have 700 more like it
across the country.

1144
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,311
You have 700 warehouses like this?

1145
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:06,873
Not just warehouse.

1146
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,998
We use church, hospital, school.

1147
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:12,309
Albania is most armed country
in the world.

1148
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:14,271
Hey, that's cool. Congrats, bro.

1149
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,356
It was like
a fucking museum in there.

1150
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:18,159
Most of this shit hadn't seen daylight

1151
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,952
since the Cold War.

1152
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:21,797
But that didn't matter to us.

1153
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,195
All we cared about was the AK ammo.

1154
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,393
It's okay. We have plenty
of what you came for.

1155
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:35,514
All these containers
are filled with your bullets.

1156
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,199
What do you mean,
all the bullets are right here?

1157
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,478
126 million rounds.

1158
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:47,635
Fuck me.

1159
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,514
Yeah. Fuck us all.

1160
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,400
How old are these?

1161
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,711
30, maybe 40 years. AK-47 bullets

1162
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,030
can last forever if properly stored.

1163
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,038
Right. Well, how were these stored?

1164
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,815
Uh, who gives a fuck
how these were stored?

1165
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,255
All that matters is they fucking work.

1166
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,554
Do they work?

1167
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:26,195
You try.

1168
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,590
They fucking worked.

1169
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,351
The entire defense industry
was scrambling over this deal.

1170
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:45,592
And the key to it was sitting
in 23 shipping containers

1171
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,112
in the back of a rusted out warehouse
on the other side of the world.

1172
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,800
We got back with just enough time

1173
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,594
to submit our bid
before the government's deadline.

1174
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:14,387
And then we waited.

1175
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,429
We waited five months.

1176
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,153
Pa.

1177
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,119
David!

1178
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:27,275
- Is that Efraim?
- What?

1179
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,474
- Is it?
- David!

1180
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,068
We fucking won!

1181
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,753
Holy shit. We won the Afghan deal.

1182
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,472
- What?
- We won the Afghan deal!

1183
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:39,914
- We won?
- We fucking won!

1184
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,751
Bro! Are you fucking kidding me?

1185
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,951
- We fucking won!
- Yeah, motherfucker!

1186
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:48,269
Yeah! Yeah, motherfucker!

1187
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,474
Before we could begin,

1188
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,871
AEY still needed to be vetted
by the government.

1189
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,472
It's a pain-in-the ass process

1190
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:03,152
involving three separate audits

1191
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,958
and an in-person interview.

1192
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,675
The audits were the biggest hurdle.

1193
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,519
I mean, we didn't even
have a real bookkeeper.

1194
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:13,710
We didn't have real books.

1195
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,355
We had to fabricate AEY's accounting

1196
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,396
going back three years.

1197
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,552
Ledgers, bank statements,
phony purchase orders,

1198
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,631
we forged it all.

1199
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:29,072
Two weeks later, we were in Rock Island,

1200
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:30,639
Illinois for our big meeting

1201
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,717
with procurement officers
from the U. S. Military.

1202
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,231
We were pretty fucking nervous.

1203
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:43,074
So Efraim thought it'd be a good idea
to get high in the parking lot.

1204
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,878
Hold up.

1205
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:58,759
Does it sound like
we're more than two people right now?

1206
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,399
Yeah.

1207
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,234
It was really strong shit.

1208
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:05,515
Okay.

1209
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,233
This is very impressive.

1210
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,911
Very impressive.

1211
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,000
Frankly, we were a tad concerned
with your performance history

1212
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,797
against a deal of this size.

1213
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,757
But after meeting you two face to face,

1214
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,917
we feel like we're in good hands
on this one.

1215
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:36,475
Well, we won't let you down,

1216
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,439
sirs.

1217
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,748
Not to mention,

1218
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,797
your bid was far too attractive
for us to pass up.

1219
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,427
Thank you. I mean, that's great to hear
because we really worked hard on this.

1220
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,436
Sorry. Excuse me.

1221
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,155
One of you just said

1222
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,716
our bid was too attractive to pass up.

1223
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,756
What did you mean by that, exactly?

1224
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,952
He means you boys lowballed
the shit out of your competition.

1225
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:04,599
Yeah. Uh...

1226
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:06,429
By how much?

1227
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
Millions.

1228
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,233
Okay.

1229
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,273
Just for me. I...

1230
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:21,158
I'm curious, how many millions?

1231
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,956
Well, technically, we're not supposed to
discuss that with you,

1232
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:28,832
but what the hell.

1233
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,118
You guys came in $53 million
lower than the nearest competition.

1234
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:38,747
Fuck! Fuck!

1235
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,828
Motherfucker!

1236
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:43,872
$53 million.

1237
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:46,837
We're okay.

1238
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,028
Look at the bright side.

1239
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:51,837
For once, the American taxpayer

1240
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,149
is getting a good deal
on a defense contract.

1241
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:56,953
Man, fuck the American taxpayer.

1242
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,554
Hello?

1243
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:17,199
Iz?

1244
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,676
Hey, Ella. Hi.

1245
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,998
How are you, sweetie?

1246
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,551
Hey. Do you know
where her blue sandals are?

1247
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,354
Oh, hey.

1248
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,516
Um, I'm not sure.

1249
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,198
But listen, can we talk for a sec?

1250
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:36,838
Mmm-hmm.

1251
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,715
I need to go back to Albania
for a couple weeks.

1252
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:41,672
A month, tops.

1253
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,387
Sure. No problem.

1254
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:05,430
Hey, what's going on?

1255
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:09,078
Ella and I are going to stay
with my mom for a while.

1256
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:10,752
What? What are you talking about?

1257
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,800
Iz, what happened?

1258
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:15,109
How come you didn't tell me
you went to Iraq?

1259
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:17,880
I was looking for the plumber's number

1260
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,234
on your computer and I saw the photos.

1261
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,795
I can explain.

1262
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,917
You said you never left
the hotel room in Jordan.

1263
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:30,755
I know. Because I didn't
want to freak you out.

1264
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:33,155
Why is it every time I catch you in a lie

1265
01:12:33,399 --> 01:12:36,756
you try to convince me
that you lied for my benefit?

1266
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,313
At what point do you
just admit you're a liar?

1267
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,591
Iz, would you stop, please?

1268
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,552
We said we'd tell each other everything.

1269
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:50,311
- You promised!
- I know! Okay, I fucked up.

1270
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,470
What else aren't you telling me?

1271
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,760
- Nothing.
- No.

1272
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,279
Seriously.

1273
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,229
You know everything now.

1274
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,671
Okay. Aren't you going to ask me
why I called the plumber?

1275
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,109
Yeah, sure. What happened?

1276
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,752
The pipe is leaking in the guest bathroom.

1277
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,993
I found this.

1278
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,029
Let me guess.
You didn't want to freak me out?

1279
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:28,314
Okay, hold on.

1280
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,158
So I hid some money under the sink.

1281
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:31,429
What's the big deal?

1282
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,631
The big deal is you hid it from me!

1283
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,880
No, I didn't!

1284
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:36,637
Then who did you hide it from?

1285
01:13:41,159 --> 01:13:44,515
I don't know. It was stupid. You're right.

1286
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,993
We're going to leave
before you think of something else to say.

1287
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:55,872
Iz, I'm sorry.

1288
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,838
Iz!

1289
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,467
Oh, fuck.

1290
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:57,993
Hey, what's up, man?

1291
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,269
What's up?

1292
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:00,600
Just getting ready to leave.

1293
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,029
What is that?

1294
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,717
I just wanted to thank you
for agreeing to go on this trip.

1295
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,387
It's not lost on me,

1296
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,875
the sacrifice you're making
for this company.

1297
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:15,512
And I really appreciate it.

1298
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:20,391
"To my partner, David.
The world is yours."

1299
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,672
- It's from Scarface.
- Of course, man. I remember.

1300
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,675
Thank you.

1301
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:30,359
Yeah.

1302
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:33,747
Uh, hey, before I go,

1303
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:35,592
I just wanted...

1304
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:38,319
What's this?

1305
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,916
It's our partnership agreement. 70-30.

1306
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:44,314
I just wanted to make it official.

1307
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:48,268
Yeah, of course.

1308
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,274
- It's a good idea.
- Cool.

1309
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,195
Man, eight fucking weeks in Albania.

1310
01:15:56,439 --> 01:15:58,828
Iz is going to hate me forever.

1311
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:02,948
No, she's going to suck your cock
every day for a year.

1312
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,113
Because we're on the verge
of making $30 million.

1313
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:13,394
Yeah, man.

1314
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:16,230
Go crush it.

1315
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,113
Thanks, bro.

1316
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,274
Nice.

1317
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,068
Hey, you've reached Iz.
You know what to do.

1318
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:43,908
Come on, Iz. Don't cut me off like this.

1319
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:49,354
I'm in Albania, at the hotel.

1320
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,596
Left the number with your mom.

1321
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,519
And if you could please just call me back

1322
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,914
because I really miss you. Okay?

1323
01:16:58,119 --> 01:17:00,475
And I love you.

1324
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,920
Bye.

1325
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,118
Good morning, buddy.

1326
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:16,832
Hey, Bashkim.

1327
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,671
Oh, I bring you Kolonat.
It's our McDonald's.

1328
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:23,390
Yeah, I'm good. But thanks.

1329
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,278
We go to work now?

1330
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:44,070
Uh-huh. No, no, no.
I said I need two trucks.

1331
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:46,475
Yeah, you just got the one here right now.

1332
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,871
Yeah. Look, I got a cargo
plane sitting at the airport.

1333
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,917
Yeah, I know. I know.

1334
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,975
Hey, let me call you right back.

1335
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,319
Hey, stop! Stop, stop!

1336
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,359
Hold up, hold up, hold up!
Hey, turn that off!

1337
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,747
What the fuck is that?

1338
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,275
Where did you get this?

1339
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,920
Yo! What's up?

1340
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:10,717
Hey, man, we got a problem.

1341
01:18:11,239 --> 01:18:13,548
- Where you at?
- I'm at Liv, bro.

1342
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,354
Trying to bang some Cuban chick
who's waiting for me at my table.

1343
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,560
Why, what do we got?

1344
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,456
Let me get this straight.
I'm in Albania right now

1345
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:20,479
freezing my ass off.

1346
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,039
You're at Liv, trying to get laid?

1347
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,599
David, it's 1:00 a.m. here.

1348
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,273
I'm blowing off some steam.

1349
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:27,416
Yeah, 1:00 a.m. is when you're
supposed to be at the office

1350
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:28,775
because that's the middle of fucking day

1351
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,279
in every country we do business with.

1352
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:32,550
Look, we got a problem
with the AK ammunition.

1353
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:35,469
- What kind of problem?
- It's Chinese.

1354
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,432
Chinese, bro?
What does that even mean, Chinese?

1355
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,153
It means it's from China.

1356
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:43,710
What are you talking about?
I was there, I saw the ammo.

1357
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,920
We both did.

1358
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:46,416
Yeah, look, I don't know what to tell you.

1359
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:47,880
They fucked us. Okay? We got played.

1360
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:50,600
Hold on. How do you even
know it's Chinese?

1361
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,597
There's Chinese writing
on every fucking crate.

1362
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,596
Trust me, it's Chinese.

1363
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,880
Yeah.

1364
01:19:06,119 --> 01:19:07,256
Henry, what the fuck!

1365
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:09,000
We've been trying to reach you
for two days!

1366
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,199
It's Efraim and David.

1367
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:11,838
We have a serious fucking problem.

1368
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:14,279
I'm listening.

1369
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,636
The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.

1370
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,716
What, you think the Afghans
who are getting

1371
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,992
shot up by the Taliban give a shit
where their ammo comes from?

1372
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:23,632
No, but the Pentagon does.

1373
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,353
Henry, you know we can't use Chinese!

1374
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,278
America has an embargo against China.

1375
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:31,234
You had your boys show us the one crate
of Albanian ammo in the entire country.

1376
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:34,079
I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you
from inspecting the other crates?

1377
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:37,475
Did you even bother to ask
what the country of origin was?

1378
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,998
Who the fuck would ask that?

1379
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:43,074
Henry, I'm staring at 100 million rounds

1380
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:46,033
of illegal Chinese ammunition
that you sold us.

1381
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,467
What are we supposed to do?

1382
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,471
Do your fucking job!

1383
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,750
The U.S. government
wants to look the other way.

1384
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,176
Don't give them a reason not to.

1385
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,760
And while you're at it,
learn the difference between

1386
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,712
"We have a problem"
and "You have a problem."

1387
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,880
Fuck!

1388
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:25,595
We were fucked.
The ammo was worthless

1389
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,877
and I was stuck in Albania
trying to piece together new suppliers

1390
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:31,469
from all over Eastern Europe.

1391
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,880
Holy shit.

1392
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,640
What the fuck are you doing here, man?

1393
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,828
I have a big idea.

1394
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,993
How did you get in my room?

1395
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:02,474
They let me in.

1396
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:04,632
I'm a trustworthy guy.

1397
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,520
Not only did they let me in,
they brought me room service.

1398
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,594
Anyway, I have a big fucking idea.

1399
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:12,314
Yeah? What's that?

1400
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,787
What if we repack?

1401
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:15,319
Repack what?

1402
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,520
The bullets!

1403
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,597
What if we repack them all?

1404
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,158
100 million rounds?

1405
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:23,118
David, it can be done.

1406
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:26,868
Think about it.
We'll also save a fortune on shipping.

1407
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:29,149
We trade out all the big,
heavy wooden crates

1408
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:30,912
for light cardboard boxes.

1409
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,189
Yeah, but it would still be Chinese ammo.

1410
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,631
Look at this towel. Okay?

1411
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,755
Turkish. Made in Turkey.

1412
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,471
Not anymore. Now it's an Albanian towel.

1413
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,029
It's only Chinese
if the packaging says it's Chinese.

1414
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:53,916
Yeah. But I mean, that's
also fucking illegal, man.

1415
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,557
We have two options.

1416
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,029
We either repack this shit and send it off

1417
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:01,958
or we can walk away
from a $300 million-deal.

1418
01:22:03,479 --> 01:22:05,118
What do you want to do?

1419
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,157
When you put it like that
there's really only one option.

1420
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,469
Our driver Bashkim
introduced us to his friend

1421
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,034
who owned a boxing and storage company
out of Tirana.

1422
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,033
This is Enver. I grew up with him.

1423
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:20,279
Nice to meet you, Enver.

1424
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:24,189
You too. Bashkim told me
a little about your situation.

1425
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:27,038
Yeah, look, to put it simply,
we have a weight problem.

1426
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:29,195
We're shipping
a large quantity of ammunition

1427
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:31,118
from Albania to Afghanistan.

1428
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:32,760
Right now, it's packed in heavy tins

1429
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,154
inside big wooden crates.

1430
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:35,554
And what we would like to do

1431
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,600
is to transfer those bullets
into plastic bags

1432
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,239
and then put those in double-walled,

1433
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:40,752
corrugated fiberboard boxes.

1434
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,920
Do you know what those are?

1435
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:46,515
Yeah, of course. For what reason?

1436
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,960
We just told you.

1437
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:49,720
What the fuck is it with this country?

1438
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,635
The original packaging, it's too heavy.

1439
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:57,680
Too many crates. We need to streamline.

1440
01:22:58,359 --> 01:23:00,237
Okay. How many crates?

1441
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:03,398
A lot. It's 100 million
rounds of ammunition.

1442
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,070
Understood. But how many actual crates?

1443
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,315
We have 68,520 crates.

1444
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,274
I've seen it.

1445
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:18,152
It's fucking crazy.

1446
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,960
Done.

1447
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,988
So 50 men, eight weeks.

1448
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:04,432
I can do it for $100,000.

1449
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,596
100,000 U.S. dollars?

1450
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,960
Yeah.

1451
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:12,313
- Give us a second.
- Yeah. One second, please.

1452
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:16,358
Okay. I'm going to talk very seriously.

1453
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,119
It was hard not to laugh.

1454
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:21,192
I mean, not only was this guy
saving the entire deal,

1455
01:24:21,399 --> 01:24:22,912
but by repacking all the ammo

1456
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:26,515
we would increase our profit margin
by almost $3 million.

1457
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,319
Where should we get dinner tonight?

1458
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,710
There's this place by the hotel.
It's pretty good.

1459
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,109
Okay. All right, go ahead.

1460
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:34,588
Okay, deal.

1461
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:43,110
It was even better than we thought.

1462
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:46,676
We were trading heavy wooden crates
for light cardboard boxes.

1463
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,632
Eight ounce tins for plastic bags.

1464
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,073
By repacking the ammo,

1465
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:54,873
we would lighten our overall load
by 180 tons.

1466
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,274
180 fucking tons!

1467
01:24:59,479 --> 01:25:03,154
That meant fewer flights
using lighter planes burning less fuel.

1468
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,871
Which all added up to more money for us.

1469
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,914
On December 8th, 2007,

1470
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:17,350
AEY delivered the first 5 million rounds

1471
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,551
to the Afghan army.

1472
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,396
It went off without a hitch.

1473
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:32,350
Come on, just say it once, sweetie.
Come on.

1474
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,591
Say "dada." Say "dada."

1475
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,868
We really have to go, David.

1476
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:40,435
No, hey, five more minutes,
please? Please?

1477
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,989
We're about to eat. My mom's waiting.

1478
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:48,277
Ella, wave goodbye to Daddy. Hmm.

1479
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,753
Bye-bye, Ella.

1480
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:52,157
Merry Christmas. I love you.

1481
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,359
Hey, can you give her to your mom
so that we can talk for a minute?

1482
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,600
I'm sorry, David.

1483
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,069
We'll call you in a couple days. Okay?

1484
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:04,119
Bye.

1485
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:26,399
Hey, this is David.

1486
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,273
Bro, you want to hear
something totally fucked up?

1487
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:31,198
Merry Christmas, Efraim.

1488
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:32,469
It's Christmas?

1489
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,715
That's why nobody's here.

1490
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,229
I was about to fire the entire office.

1491
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:38,112
Anyway, when I was over there,

1492
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:40,310
I was talking to our boy, Bashkim.

1493
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,588
Did you know his uncle

1494
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,114
works at the Albanian defense ministry?

1495
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:45,319
No, I didn't know that.

1496
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,560
Well, he does.

1497
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,519
So I said, "You know what would be
interesting to me, Bashkim?

1498
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,072
"I'd be curious to know what Henry
is paying the Albanians for the AK ammo."

1499
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:55,279
Efraim?

1500
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,033
Do you know what he found out?

1501
01:26:57,239 --> 01:27:00,710
That motherfucker is paying
two and a half cents a round.

1502
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,989
He's charging us a 400% markup!

1503
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:04,997
Yeah. So what? We do the same thing.

1504
01:27:05,239 --> 01:27:06,514
Yeah, but this is our contract.

1505
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,439
And we almost lost it because of him
and his Chinese fucking bullets.

1506
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,560
But we didn't lose it.

1507
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,828
That's not the point!

1508
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:14,615
I want to figure out a way
to cut this cocksucker out of the deal.

1509
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,868
Efraim, stop.

1510
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:17,154
No, listen to me.

1511
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:19,032
I'm serious, man.

1512
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:20,467
We're making money, okay?

1513
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,512
He's making money,
the whole thing is fucking working.

1514
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,073
Don't mess with it.

1515
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:27,713
I don't give a fuck. He's ripping us off!

1516
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,920
Look, I'm serious, okay?

1517
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:32,840
I'm going to be on the next flight
out of here if you pull that shit.

1518
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,795
Whoa. Bro, you don't have to threaten me.

1519
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,432
All right? I'm your partner.

1520
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,551
Yeah, it doesn't always feel like that.

1521
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,390
I found this deal. And I'm over here

1522
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,159
doing all the work and you're in Miami
trying to sabotage it.

1523
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:48,277
How am I sabotaging it?

1524
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:51,711
By trying to fuck over Henry,
the way you fuck over everybody else.

1525
01:27:56,119 --> 01:27:59,635
You're right. Henry's our partner.

1526
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,591
He's the reason we got this deal.

1527
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:08,836
I was just looking out for us
and I took it too far.

1528
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:12,550
Don't sweat it, bro. I'll leave it alone.

1529
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,914
Thank you.

1530
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,869
We can't push our luck
with this shit, man.

1531
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:21,792
All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

1532
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:33,229
Whoa. What the fuck? Hey.

1533
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,560
Fuck! Stop.

1534
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,192
Stop! I don't understand!

1535
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,951
Do you understand now?

1536
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,988
Yeah. Yes.

1537
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,751
Did you really think
you could cut me out of my own deal?

1538
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:43,680
Please.

1539
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:02,880
Fuck.

1540
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,520
Fuck.

1541
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:21,319
David, we need to talk.

1542
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,793
Now's not a good time.

1543
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:27,270
I have not been paid yet.

1544
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,000
What do you mean? Like for the month?

1545
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,394
Ever.

1546
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,476
You haven't been paid anything?

1547
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,069
Your partner doesn't return phone calls.

1548
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:37,150
My guys need to be paid.

1549
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:39,590
They are going to stop work.

1550
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,551
David, I know the real reason

1551
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,431
that you want ammunition repacked.

1552
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:50,552
Okay, look, Enver. Listen to me.

1553
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,034
I gotta fly to Miami right now.
I'll be back in a week.

1554
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:54,199
But I promise you,

1555
01:30:54,359 --> 01:30:55,576
the first thing that
I'm going do when I land

1556
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,716
is make sure
you get your money wired, okay?

1557
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:02,439
Okay.

1558
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,640
David.

1559
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:10,189
Airport, let's go.

1560
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,948
David.

1561
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,715
Look, I'm late for a flight.
I'll be back next week.

1562
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,956
She said her husband
didn't come home last night.

1563
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,756
Okay, what do you want me to do?

1564
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,996
She's very worried. It is not like him.

1565
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,358
Tell her I don't know her husband.

1566
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,560
Who's your husband?

1567
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,671
Bashkim.

1568
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,029
No one ever heard
from Bashkim again.

1569
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:50,630
They never found a note,
they never found a body.

1570
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,351
He just fell off the planet.

1571
01:31:57,279 --> 01:31:58,872
I was done with Albania.

1572
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:02,110
I was never going back.

1573
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:13,359
Hi.

1574
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,840
Hey.

1575
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:20,194
The reason I went to Albania
was to repackage Chinese ammunition

1576
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,198
so we could disguise it
and sell it to the U.S. government.

1577
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:27,155
That sounds illegal.

1578
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,916
It is. But I'm done.

1579
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,479
I swear, no matter what happens
for the rest of my life

1580
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,398
I'm never going to lie to you again.

1581
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:42,673
Mmm-hmm.

1582
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,551
I love you so much, Iz.

1583
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:55,828
What happened to your nose?

1584
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,036
I was kidnapped by Albanian gangsters.

1585
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,559
- I think it's broken.
- Oh, my God.

1586
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,427
I think I'm going to go back
to being a massage therapist.

1587
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,028
Is that okay?

1588
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:13,592
Yes.

1589
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,832
It was always okay.

1590
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,359
Hey, you're back.

1591
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,948
Whoa!

1592
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,399
Bro, what are you doing back?
What happened to your face?

1593
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,695
That's everything that's been delivered
on the Afghan deal.

1594
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,868
I want my cut. I'm out.

1595
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,753
What are you talking about?

1596
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,350
He put a fucking gun to my head, man.

1597
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,868
Who, Henry?

1598
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:10,960
You said that you were going
to leave it alone.

1599
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,238
Oh, fuck.

1600
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,676
I fucked up.

1601
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:20,074
I'm done, Efraim.

1602
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:22,270
Look, you don't have to go back.

1603
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,872
I hired this new guy, Ivan.

1604
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:25,917
- He speaks Albanian.
- I'm done.

1605
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:34,469
What, do you think
I just got 4 million bucks laying around?

1606
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,028
I've thought it through.

1607
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,195
I'll take 40 cents on the dollar.

1608
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:46,230
Yeah, I thought it through too.

1609
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,748
How about this?

1610
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:49,877
How about zero cents on the dollar?

1611
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:53,153
Let me remind you that we have a contract.

1612
01:34:53,399 --> 01:34:54,673
Fuck your contract!

1613
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,432
If I asked you to build me a house,

1614
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,319
and you quit after building me
half a house,

1615
01:34:58,399 --> 01:34:59,800
you think I owe you half the money?

1616
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,911
Is this a fucking joke, David?

1617
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:04,587
You have two weeks.
Otherwise, you'll hear from my lawyer.

1618
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:06,837
Who, Warren?

1619
01:35:07,279 --> 01:35:09,430
Are you talking about Warren?
He's my lawyer too.

1620
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,828
I introduced you to him.

1621
01:35:11,479 --> 01:35:12,912
Fucking Warren.

1622
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:24,588
Fuck!

1623
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:52,112
AEY.
How may I direct your call?

1624
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:16,719
We fight.

1625
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:19,832
Fight with our families,

1626
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:21,797
fight with our business associates.

1627
01:36:23,079 --> 01:36:25,115
Sometimes we fight with our friends.

1628
01:36:25,399 --> 01:36:26,399
If God were here,

1629
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,953
we'd probably fight with Him too.

1630
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,275
Efraim has a heavy heart
over what's happened.

1631
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,435
No offense, Ralph, but I'm not sure
you've ever met the real Efraim.

1632
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:44,788
He's a complicated young man.

1633
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,751
But he just wants to sit down and talk.

1634
01:36:48,359 --> 01:36:49,792
Find a fair solution.

1635
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,238
He's asked me to mediate.

1636
01:36:57,399 --> 01:36:59,152
Let me help you, David.

1637
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:03,389
I just don't know
if I'm ready yet.

1638
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,635
All right, here he is.

1639
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:15,994
Hey, bro.

1640
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,909
Good to see you.

1641
01:37:27,479 --> 01:37:29,515
Sorry things have gotten so crazy.

1642
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:31,717
Yeah. Me too.

1643
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,557
You having anything, hon?

1644
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,796
I'll just have a coffee. Thanks.

1645
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:39,952
I've thought about it a lot.

1646
01:37:42,119 --> 01:37:44,587
And I don't want you to walk away
from this empty-handed.

1647
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,788
Cool.

1648
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:49,600
So I had Warren draft up
a severance agreement.

1649
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,273
And I think it's pretty fair.

1650
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:56,399
I'm prepared to pay you 50K per year
for the next four years.

1651
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,033
200 grand?

1652
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,511
Is this a fucking joke, man?

1653
01:38:07,399 --> 01:38:09,072
Is this what you meant by mediation?

1654
01:38:09,319 --> 01:38:10,600
In all fairness, there was never

1655
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,716
a partnership agreement,
no prior contract.

1656
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:16,958
Yeah. I have something better
than a partnership agreement.

1657
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:18,952
I have proof.

1658
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,667
Before I left Albania, I took everything.

1659
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,880
What the fuck.

1660
01:38:23,159 --> 01:38:25,798
All the documents we forged,
photos of repacking.

1661
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:27,079
- David!
- Repacking?

1662
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:28,507
- He didn't tell you?
- David!

1663
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,296
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1664
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:33,153
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1665
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:36,198
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the U.S. Military.

1666
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:39,073
Yeah, and we made
$8 million doing it, asshole.

1667
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:40,279
Careful, Efraim.

1668
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:42,095
We told Ralph we only made
$3 million on that one.

1669
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:43,119
Wait, what now?

1670
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:45,136
He sends you fake accounting
reports every month.

1671
01:38:45,159 --> 01:38:46,840
- Oh, fuck off.
- I make them on my laptop.

1672
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:48,314
Now you're just making shit up.

1673
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,710
Really? Because I kept everything,
you dumb fuck!

1674
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,559
I even have copies of the bank statements
that we photoshopped

1675
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,840
and sent to the government.

1676
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,069
Get the fuck out of here.

1677
01:38:58,439 --> 01:39:00,112
I can bury you.

1678
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,034
Us.

1679
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,351
I think you meant to say,

1680
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,869
you can bury us.

1681
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,190
Because anything that implicates me,

1682
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,868
implicates you as well.

1683
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:20,199
- Efraim, wait.
- No, no, no.

1684
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:23,948
I came here today prepared
to pay you $200,000.

1685
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,512
Now I'm not even going to pay
for breakfast.

1686
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,832
Oh. What's going on over here? Huh?

1687
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:43,079
Hello?

1688
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:45,110
May I speak with David Packouz?

1689
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:47,310
- Yeah, who's this?
- Hi, David.

1690
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,591
This is C.J. Chivers
with The New York Times.

1691
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,439
I was wondering if you had a minute
to talk about AEY,

1692
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,949
and the alleged repackaging
of Chinese ammunition.

1693
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,119
I don't know what you're talking about.

1694
01:40:00,279 --> 01:40:02,576
Well, according to my source,
there's an ongoing investigation

1695
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,600
at the State Department.

1696
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,600
And I was hoping
to get some clarification...

1697
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,876
David, this sounds pretty serious.

1698
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:19,399
Yeah, I know.

1699
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,112
Maybe you should call my uncle.

1700
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,073
The lawyer.

1701
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:27,640
Oh, my God. Okay.

1702
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,431
That's a good idea.

1703
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,234
Hey, give me a minute.
I'll meet you guys in the lobby.

1704
01:40:45,399 --> 01:40:47,708
You just get a call
from The New York Times?

1705
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:49,039
Yeah.

1706
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,868
Me too.

1707
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,868
You know, Scarface was on TV last night,

1708
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:07,318
and I was watching it and thinking about
when we were little

1709
01:41:08,199 --> 01:41:10,838
and we used to do the lines
from the movie.

1710
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,350
You're my best friend, David.

1711
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,988
God, I really fucked this up, didn't I?

1712
01:41:25,239 --> 01:41:26,912
I'm sorry, bro.

1713
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:33,469
Wow.

1714
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,036
Are you ever not acting, man?

1715
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,715
What does that mean?

1716
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,274
You just tell me
what you think I want to hear,

1717
01:41:41,479 --> 01:41:42,655
because The New York Times called,

1718
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,680
and you're freaking out
that I might say something.

1719
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:48,474
Just admit it.

1720
01:41:49,159 --> 01:41:51,195
We were never best friends.

1721
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,034
You were just playing
the part of my best friend.

1722
01:41:56,439 --> 01:41:57,953
Yeah.

1723
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,634
Scarface wasn't even on TV last night.

1724
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:13,752
You're such a piece of shit.

1725
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,591
- Fuck!
- Fuck you.

1726
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,676
- Fuck.
- Little bitch.

1727
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,311
Well, that saves us a trip.

1728
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,954
Out of all the illegal shit we did,

1729
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,994
all the lies we told the government,

1730
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,988
in the end, the thing that did us in?

1731
01:43:11,239 --> 01:43:15,073
Yes, I'm trying to reach
the Department of Defense, please.

1732
01:43:16,359 --> 01:43:18,873
Efraim never paid the box guy.

1733
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:23,034
T o who do you report a crime?

1734
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,712
After Enver called the Pentagon,

1735
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,434
the State Department launched
a full-scale investigation,

1736
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,476
that went on for months.

1737
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:38,194
They busted Ralph at one of his shops
in the middle of a work day.

1738
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,631
He was horrified
and couldn't make a deal fast enough.

1739
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:49,072
All that bullshit about him wanting
to mediate a truce between Efraim and I...

1740
01:43:50,279 --> 01:43:51,395
It was a setup.

1741
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,239
Oh, yeah, we took that money you gave us,

1742
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:56,113
and we bought 100 million rounds
of illegal Chinese ammunition,

1743
01:43:56,319 --> 01:43:59,551
then we repackaged it
and sold it to the U. S. Military.

1744
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,478
They had us dead to rights.

1745
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,358
It was pathetic.

1746
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,798
While going through Efraim's computer,
they even found a to-do list that said,

1747
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,069
"Repackage Chinese ammo."

1748
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:13,474
The story tonight
that has Pentagon officials scrambling.

1749
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:18,595
How did two 20-something young men
land a big Pentagon contract?

1750
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,095
Federal agents arrested

1751
01:44:20,119 --> 01:44:21,917
both men last week,
charging them with fraud

1752
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:25,237
for selling outdated, defective
Chinese ammunition

1753
01:44:25,479 --> 01:44:26,832
to the Pentagon.

1754
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,954
Efraim was charged
with over 70 federal crimes

1755
01:44:30,199 --> 01:44:32,555
and sentenced to four years in prison.

1756
01:44:34,279 --> 01:44:37,750
I pled guilty and was sentenced
to seven months house arrest.

1757
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:47,390
Congress called the Afghanistan contract
a case study

1758
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,989
in all that is wrong
with the government's procurement process.

1759
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:05,796
In 2022, AEY will be eligible once again
to bid on Federal contracts.

1760
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,787
How's it going?

1761
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:21,828
It's okay.

1762
01:45:23,439 --> 01:45:26,351
If I wanted you dead,
you'd already be dead.

1763
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,234
I guess it's going all right then.

1764
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,755
Come in.

1765
01:45:42,199 --> 01:45:43,952
How's your baby?

1766
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:45,639
It's a girl, right?

1767
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,716
Yeah. She's good.

1768
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:49,878
I got three.

1769
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:52,234
All girls.

1770
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:54,559
They tell you it gets better.

1771
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:56,954
That's not true, it gets worse.

1772
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,238
That's why I like the arms business.

1773
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:01,635
No women.

1774
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,427
I want to apologize about Albania.

1775
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:22,628
I had bad information.

1776
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:30,877
So you stuffed me in the trunk of a car
and shoved a gun in my face by mistake?

1777
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:32,114
Yeah.

1778
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:37,431
I'm not a bad man,
but in certain situations,

1779
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,073
I have to ask myself,

1780
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,636
what would a bad man do?

1781
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,872
I appreciate you leaving my name
out of your testimony.

1782
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,036
I didn't really see
a reason to include it.

1783
01:46:55,239 --> 01:46:56,752
Yeah, but still.

1784
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,519
Can I ask you a question?

1785
01:47:01,239 --> 01:47:02,309
Sure.

1786
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:08,474
When we met in Vegas
at the blackjack table,

1787
01:47:09,239 --> 01:47:10,592
was that a coincidence?

1788
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,238
What do you think?

1789
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:21,471
Can I ask you another question?

1790
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:25,953
My driver in Albania went missing.

1791
01:47:27,319 --> 01:47:29,275
Do you know what happened to him?

1792
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,752
It's a piece of my end on the Afghan deal.

1793
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,918
It's for you.

1794
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,756
No more questions.
